; TODO: I am currently *maybe* seeing a slight weirdness with some of the LEDs when they first start animating - it's probably fine, but have a look and see if not all are initialised or the fact that some panels don't use *all* the LED slots has some kind of impact - I *think* this was caused by not initialising state_table and count_table every time, so after the first animation the LEDs didn't all start in sync - if so I have now fixed this, will leave this TODO in place for a bit in case there was another cause
